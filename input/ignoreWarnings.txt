[Unable to determine whether the provided codes are in the value set http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/genomics-reporting/ValueSet/condition-inheritance-mode-vs because the value set or a code system it depends on is not known to the validator, Code System URI 'http://hpo.jax.org/app/' is unknown so the code cannot be validated]


# these messages are also from LOINC answer lists not being loaded at tx.fhir.org (and causes the validator to fail like this).
