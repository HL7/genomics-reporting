# This is a publisher induced issue.   The extension in question is introduced by the publisher.   See https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179252-IG-creation/topic/New.20ConceptMap.20Warning.20--.20induced.20by.20IG.20Publisher 
The modifier extension http://hl7.org/fhir/1.0/StructureDefinition/extension-ConceptMap.element.target.equivalence from FHIR version {3} is not allowed to be used at this point (allowed = e:ConceptMap.element.target; this element is [[BackboneElement, ConceptMap.group.element.target]; this is a warning since contexts may be renamed between FHIR versions)

# ignore warnings about annotations in UCUM codes
%Best Practice is not to depend on annotations in the UCUM code, so this usage should be checked%
