# Each of these reference MolecularSequence. Our profiles limit Observation.derivedFrom() to other profiles, but in HLA use cases, they use it to reference to MolecularSequence. The group has decided we can allow MolecularSequence, but we do not want to update our slicing as this is more of an edge case, versus the typical case of referring to our other profiles.

# Misc information messages
The repeating element has a pattern. The pattern will apply to all the repeats (this has not been clear to all users)
The string value contains text that looks like embedded HTML tags. If this content is rendered to HTML without appropriate post-processing, it may be a security risk

# Preferred and extensible warnings
None of the codings provided are in the value set 'Observation Category Codes' (http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/observation-category|4.0.1), and a coding is recommended to come from this value set) (codes = http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0074#GE)
