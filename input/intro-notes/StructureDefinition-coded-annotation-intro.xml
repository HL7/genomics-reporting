    This Profile adds a CodeableConcept to the Annotation data-type. This allows implementing use-cases to give a coded meaning to notes (e.g. Test disclaimer, tumor board preparation note).
    Annotation is a FHIR data type, this is <b>NOT</b> about annotations in the genomic context.
    <br/>
    This data-type is meant to capture notes. If there is a possibility of transporting the note in a structured manner the usage of coded-annotation is forbidden and the corresponding data structures SHALL be used.
