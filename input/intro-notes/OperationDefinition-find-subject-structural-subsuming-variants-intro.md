### Description
	
Determine if structural variants are present that fully subsume a range. (See section '[Use of genomic regions](operations.html#use-of-genomic-regions)' for the distinction between variants that 'intersect' vs. 'subsume' a region; see section '[Simple vs. Structural variant operations](operations.html#simple-structural)' for the distinction between simple and structural variants).
