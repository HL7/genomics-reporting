		The Genomic Implication profile is an abstract for the Theraputic and Diagnostic implications. Implications are relevant information which is derieved from the presence of a haplotype, genotype, variant or other observed genetic change.
	This portion of the implementation guide relies on the content in the <a href="general.html">General Genomic Reporting</a> and <a href="sequencing.html">Variant Reporting</a> portions of this implementation guide.  
  </p>

 <p>
    This profile defines a common set of elements for other Implications:
 </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>Related Artifact (base extension)</code> supports conveying references to citations, supporting documentation and other information relevant to the asserted implication</li>
    <li><code>evidence-level (component)</code> indicates the strength of the evidence behind the asserted implication</li>
  </ul>

<p>
	Here are some examples of how the evidence-level component can be used (NOTE - they would be used in the appropriate, use case specific profile):

	<h3>Differentiating AND vs OR</h3>
	<p>
		There are several cases where it is necessary to differentiate 'AND' conditions (e.g. both drug X AND drug Y, in combination, are indicated in the presence of a variant) vs. 'OR' conditions (e.g., either drug X OR drug Y are indicated in the presence of a variant).

		This situation is not unique to genomic implications, and arises elsewhere within FHIR (e.g. <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#combining">FHIR Search</a>) and outside of FHIR (e.g., <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/api_http/">ClinVar submission API</a> condition set). To be consistent with other precedents:
  </p>
  <p>
		Where Diagnostic and Therapeutic implications have fields with cardinality > 1, the inclusion of multiple values within a field SHALL indicate an 'AND' condition. An 'OR' condition SHALL be represented by multiple observation instances.
	</p>
	<p>
		Implication fields affected by this guidance include:
	</p>
		<p>
		<a href="StructureDefinition-molecular-consequence.html">Molecular consequences</a>: derivedFrom, evidence-level, feature-consequence.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="StructureDefinition-therapeutic-implication.html">Therapeutic implications</a>: derivedFrom, evidence-level, therapeutic-implication, phenotypic-treatment-context, medication-assessed, therapy-assessed.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="StructureDefinition-diagnostic-implication.html">Diagnostic implications</a>: derivedFrom, evidence-level, predicted-phenotype, genomic-risk-assessment.
	</p>
	<p>
		As an example, assume Variant X is pathogenic for Disease Y AND Disease Z in combination. This would be a single diagnostic implication, where predicted-phenotype is a list containing both Disease Y and Disease Z. If on the other hand, Variant X might be pathogenic for Disease Y alone, or Disease Z alone, this would be two diagnostic implications, one containing a predicted-phenotype of Disease Y, and the other containing a predicted-phenotype of Disease Z.
