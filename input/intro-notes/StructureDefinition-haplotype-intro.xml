    Haplotype describe a set of genomic <a href="StructureDefinition-variant.html">variations</a> that appear on a single strand of DNA - and which are therefore typically inherited together. Many haplotypes are expressed as simple strings, and can be conveyed in <code>valueCodeableConcept.text</code>. In some cases, haplotypes are sufficiently standardized to be conveyed as codes in <code>valueCodeableConcept.code</code>.
  </p>
 <p>
    For Pharmacogenomics, implementers SHOULD send coded haplotypes.  Here is an example using PharmVar:
    <ul>
      <li>Coded PGx<br/>
        <div class="example"><pre class="json">
{
  "valueCodeableConcept": {
    "coding": [{
      "system": "http://www.pharmvar.org",
      "code": "PV01777",
      "display": "CYP2C9*3.002"
    }]
    "text": "CYP2C9*3B"
  }
}
        </pre></div>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    For both genotypes and haplotypes, reporting the structured variant data is optional. However, implementers SHOULD when possible. For example, sending PGX star-alleles without variant-level information is not best practice as it is both potentially ambiguous and can preclude future utility of the report.
  </p>
  <p>
    Review the <a href="StructureDefinition-genotype.html">Genotypes</a> page for guidance on reporting genotypes and haplotypes together.
