    Haplotype describe a set of genomic <a href="StructureDefinition-variant.html">variations</a> that appear on a single strand of DNA - and which are therefore typically inherited together. Many haplotypes are expressed as simple strings, and can be conveyed in <code>valueCodeableConcept.text</code>. In some cases, haplotypes are sufficiently standardized to be conveyed as codes in <code>valueCodeableConcept.code</code>.
