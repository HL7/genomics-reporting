    This section provides guidance for genomic reporting about the implication of a patient's genetics on the behavior of one or more medications.  This includes making recommendations for medication adjustments.  This portion of the implementation guide relies on the content in the <a href="general.html">General Genomic Reporting</a> and <a href="sequencing.html">Variant Reporting</a> portions of this implementation guide.  Pharmacogenomic reports supplement this information with a set of pharmacogenomic-specific implication profiles.  Implementers of pharmacogenomic reporting may also be interested in the <a href="somatics.html">Somatic Reporting</a> section of this implementation guide.

  <h3>Communicating disease or tumor context</h3>
  <p>
   In general, treatments and medications have a set of indications for use which are not explicitly stated. However, if a pharmacogenomics statement has a specific context of a disease or a tumor use the component <code>phenotypic-treatment-context</code> to indicate the disease.

    )
  </p>
  <p>
    The profile component medication-assessed is the place to communicate the medication whose implication is being described, including a place for the coded value of the medication. The <code>therapy-assessed</code> component is not intended for medications. Because this is an international profile, no guidance is provided on drug coding systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    The component <code>Predicted Therapeutic Implication</code> lists one or more ramifications based on the presence of associated molecular finding(s), which may include:
  </p>
  <ul>
	<li>Alterations in drug metabolism (or pharmacokinetics) that determine the concentration of the drug, prodrug, and/or break-down products over time;</li>
  <li>Alterations in drug efficacy (or pharmacodynamics) that determine how effective a drug is at a given concentration;</li>
  <li>Alterations that alter the risk of adverse drug events, or other types of implications that indicate altered responsiveness to other types of therapies or eligibility for clinical trials;</li>
	<li>Other pharmacogenomic statements as necessary, by extending the valueSet.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <a name="pgxRecommendedAction"> </a>
  <h3>Including Pharmacogenomic recommended actions</h3>
  <p>
	To associate a Therapeutic-implication instance with a recommended action (e.g. discontinuing a medication, altering dosage, "choose alternative medication") use <a href="StructureDefinition-medication-recommendation.html">Medication Usage Implication</a>, Recommended action, along with Current Medication if appropriate. Use "related artifact" in Therapeutic-implication for supporting documents such as CPIC guidelines. 
  </p>
  <p>
	Medication Usage Implications (medication-recommendation) link to therapeutic implications through "reasonReference"and are included in the report as links for RecommendedAction, DiagnosticReport.extension:RecommendedAction. The therapeutic implications do not have a link to medication usage implications (medication-recommendation): so rev_include is currently necessary to find the therapeutic implication statements relevant to the medication usage implications. 
  </p>
  <p>
	Note: if multiple medications are used in medication assessed, the usage implication should describe the combined effect. Note 2:  Implementers may also be interested in the <a href="somatics.html">Somatic Reporting</a> and <a href="pharmacogenomics.html">Pharmacogenomics Reporting</a> sections of this implementation guide.

	<a name="Differentiating AND vs OR"> </a>
	<h3>Differentiating AND vs OR</h3>
	<p>
		There are several cases where it is necessary to differentiate 'AND' conditions (e.g. both drug X AND drug Y, in combination, are indicated in the presence of a variant) vs. 'OR' conditions (e.g. either drug X OR drug Y are indicated in the presence of a variant).
		This situation is not unique to genomic implications, and arises elsewhere within FHIR (e.g. <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#combining">FHIR Search</a>) and outside of FHIR (e.g. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/api_http/">Clinvar submission API</a> condition set). To be consistent with other precedents:
	</p>
	<p>
		Where Diagnostic and Therapeutic implications have fields with cardinality >1, the inclusion of multiple values within a field shall indicate an 'AND' condition. An 'OR' condition is represented by multiple observation instances.

	</p>
	<p>see <a href="StructureDefinition-implication.html#differentiating-and-vs-or">Genomic Implication</a> for additional information.
