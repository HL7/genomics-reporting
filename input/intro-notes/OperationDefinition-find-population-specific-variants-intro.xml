	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>Retrieve count or list of patients having specified variants.</p>

	<p>Population queries are designed to return a <b>count</b> of patients (from a specified cohort) that match each item sought, with or without a <b>list</b> of patients matching the item(s) sought.</p>
	<p>Determining the cohort to be searched (also known as the 'denominator') in a given situation can be complex - criteria might be based on demographic data (e.g. age >= 65), clinical data (e.g. lung cancer), etc. Rather than enumerating possible filters that might be used to define a denominator population, these operations allow for the inclusion of a subject list as an input parameter. If a list of subjects is not supplied, then the denominator is the entire population managed by the server. Servers unable to provide patient lists can indicate this using a <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/capabilitystatement.html">FHIR Capability Statement</a>.</p>
