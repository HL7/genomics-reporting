    Genotype describes combinations of genomic variations that together are associated with a particular phenotype - i.e., a specific physical, behavioral, or risk-associated difference associated with the organism whose specimen was tested. Genotype is used to convey corresponding <a href="StructureDefinition-haplotype.html">haplotypes</a> or <a href="StructureDefinition-variant.html">variations</a> at a particular locus. Many genotypes are expressed as simple strings, and can be conveyed in <code>valueCodeableConcept.text</code>. In some cases, genotypes are sufficiently standardized to be conveyed as codes in <code>valueCodeableConcept.code</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For HLA, KIR, and other genes in the immunogenomics domain, the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) led a community effort to define the Genotype List String (GL String) grammar, described <a href="https://glstring.org">here</a>. Notably, the GL String uses '+' as a delimiter between alleles in a genotype. It also has delimiters for ambiguous genotypes, allele lists, and haplotypes.
  </p>
  <p>
    For Pharmacogenomics, implementers SHOULD send coded haplotypes, and for genotypes (diplotypes) MAY use a simple, human readable grammar of:
  </p>
  <p>
    [HGNC gene symbol], followed by white space, followed by a slash ('/') delimited list of haplotype names].
  </p>
  <p>
    Here are some examples that are standardized, note that there are examples which still lack standardization today.
    <ul>
      <li>Coded HLA (glstring)<br/>
        <div class="example"><pre class="json">
{
  "valueCodeableConcept": {
    "coding": [{
      "system": "http://glstring.org",
      "version": "1.0",
      "code": "#hla#3.23#HLA-A*01:01:01:01/HLA-A*01:02+HLA-A*24:02:01:01"
    }]
  }
}
        </pre></div>
      </li>
      <li>PGx Genotype (textually represents the CYP2C9 *2C haplotype (or 'star allele') on one chromosome and the CYP2C9 *1A haplotype on the homologous chromosome)<br/>
        <div class="example"><pre class="json">
{
  "valueCodeableConcept": {
    "text": "CYP2C9 *2C/*1A"
  }
}
        </pre></div>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    For both genotypes and haplotypes, reporting the structured variant data is optional. However, implementers SHOULD when possible. For example, sending PGX star-alleles without variant-level information is not best practice as it is both potentially ambiguous and can preclude future utility of the report.
