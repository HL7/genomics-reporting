	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>Retrieve count or list of patients having diagnostic implications. More specifically, this operation retrieves the count +/- list of patients that have diagnostic implications involving specific conditions, derived from specific variants/haplotypes/genotypes.</p>
	
	<p>A patient meets numerator criteria if they have at least one diagnostic implication matching the query parameters.</p>

	<p>As shown in the following picture, this operation can return previously instantiated implications and/or dynamically computed implications. Specific implementations can indicate their capabilities using a <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/capabilitystatement.html">FHIR Capability Statement</a>. Rules around the retention of dynamically computed implications are outside the scope of this operation, but a server could potentially instantiate those results based on the <a href="StructureDefinition-therapeutic-implication.html">Therapeutic Implication</a> and <a href="StructureDefinition-diagnostic-implication.html">Diagnostic Implication</a> FHIR profiles. </p>

	<p>Population queries are designed to return a <b>count</b> of patients that match each item sought, with or without a <b>list</b> of patients matching the item(s) sought.</p>
