	<h4>Common Elements</h4>

 <p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>secondary-finding (extension)</code> can flag an observation as a secondary finding, a finding that is unrelated to the primary purpose for the test</li>
    <li><code>partOf</code> is limited to references which are applicable to genomic observations</li>
    <li><code>category</code> slices required two categories for all genomic observations in order to facilitate more efficient queries</li>
    <li><code>note</code> is a <a href="StructureDefinition-coded-annotation.html">CodedAnnotation</a> that allow all comments to also contain coded type</li>
    <li><code>derivedFrom</code> is limited to references which are applicable to genomic observations</li>
    <li><code>conclusion-string (component)</code> represents a summary conclusion to provide interpretation or impression guidance</li>
  </ul>
