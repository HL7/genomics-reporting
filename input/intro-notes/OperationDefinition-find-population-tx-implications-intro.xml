	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>Retrieve count or list of patients having therapeutic implications. More specifically, this operation retrieves the count +/- list of patients that have therapeutic implications involving specific treatments and/or conditions, derived from specific variants/haplotypes/genotypes.</p>
	
	<p>A patient meets numerator criteria if they have at least one therapeutic implication matching the query parameters.</p>

	<p>As shown in the following picture, this operation can return previously instantiated implications and/or dynamically computed implications. Specific implementations can indicate their capabilities using a <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/capabilitystatement.html">FHIR Capability Statement</a>. Rules around the retention of dynamically computed implications are outside the scope of this operation, but a server could potentially instantiate those results based on the <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/StructureDefinition-therapeutic-implication.html">Therapeutic Implication</a> and <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/genomics-reporting/StructureDefinition-diagnostic-implication.html">Diagnostic Implication</a> FHIR profiles. </p>
	<img src="implications.png" alt="Instantiated vs Dynamically Computed Implications"/>

	<p>Dynamic computation of implications can return a large number of results (e.g. 'find therapeutic implications for cancer'). Results can be curtailed using additional operation parameters (e.g. 'find therapeutic implications for somatic variant NM_007294.4:c.5578del in breast cancer"). 
</p>

	<p>Population queries are designed to return a <b>count</b> of patients that match each item sought, with or without a <b>list</b> of patients matching the item(s) sought.</p>
