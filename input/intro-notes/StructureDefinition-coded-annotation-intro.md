This Profile adds a CodeableConcept to the FHIR Annotation data-type. This allows implementing use-cases to give a coded meaning to notes (e.g. Test disclaimer, tumor board preparation note).
Annotation is a FHIR data type, this is **NOT** about annotations in the genomic context.

This data-type is meant to capture notes. If there is a possibility of transporting the note in a structured manner the usage of coded-annotation is forbidden and the corresponding data structures SHALL be used.
