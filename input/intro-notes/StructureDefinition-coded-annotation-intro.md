This profile adds a CodeableConcept extension to the Annotation data type. The Annotation data type is meant to capture text notes plus information about who made the statement and when. This new extension gives a coded meaning (e.g. Test disclaimer, tumor board preparation note) to the notes. If there is a possibility of transporting the content of the note in a structured manner the usage of CodedAnnotation is forbidden and the corresponding data structures SHALL be used.
