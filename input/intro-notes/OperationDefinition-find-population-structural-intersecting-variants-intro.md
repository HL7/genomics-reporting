### Description
	
Retrieve count or list of patients having structural intersecting variants in specified regions. (See section '[Genes vs. Regions](operations.html#genes-vs-regions)' for the distinction between variants that 'intersect' vs. 'subsume' a region).

A patient meets numerator criteria if they have at least one structural variant intersecting a given range.

Population queries are designed to return a **count** of patients that match each item sought, with or without a **list** of patients matching the item(s) sought.
