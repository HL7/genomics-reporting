  <p>
    This guide introduces Observation profiles to report results of tests that involve sequencing the DNA, RNA or amino acid chains of specimens. This includes direct sequencing, shotgun sequencing, array-based variant testing, and other mechanisms. See the <a href="index.html">scope</a> and <a href="background.html">overview</a> sections for more details.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, there is one profile used to model most variant information. In future versions of this implementation guide, HL7 may subdivide Variant into multiple sub-profiles with more specific purpose.
  </p>
<a name="VariantOverview"></a>
<h3>Variant Profile Scope</h3>
<p>
The purpose of the Variant Observation profile is to capture genomic data elements fulfilling the following three purposes:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>to <b>define</b> a variant of interest, which could be a simple, well understood change from a reference sequence, or one of several types of structural variations with uncertain endpoints. </li>
  <li>to <b>contextualize</b> the observation of the defined variant (e.g., presence or absence in the sample and determinations of state or inheritance). </li>
  <li>to terminologically <b>classify</b> the variant according to the type or location of the change (generally optional, but needed to define certain types of structural variations). </li>
</ol>
<p>
It is NOT intended to support other Observations that are clinically relevant on their own and have separate profiles defined in this guide, including:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  statements of pathogenicity or of correlations with conditions or therapeutic interactions (see <a href="pharmacogenomics.html">pharmacogenomics</a>, <a href="StructureDefinition-therapeutic-implication.html"> Therapeutic Implication</a>, and <a href="StructureDefinition-diagnostic-implication.html"> Diagnostic Implication</a>. Note that these statement observations will often use `Observation.derivedFrom` to point to one or more variants. This approach allows those statements to be reevaluated and updated or created downstream as the underlying knowledge bases and guidelines are updated.
  </li>
  <li>
  Presence statements of whole haplotypes, genotypes, or phasing data (see <a href="StructureDefinition-haplotype.html">Haplotype</a>, <a href="StructureDefinition-genotype.html">Genotype</a>, and <a href="StructureDefinition-sequence-phase-relationship.html">Sequence Phase Relationship</a>);
  </li>
</ol>


<a name="DefiningVariants"></a>
<h3>Defining Variants</h3>
<p>This Implementation Guide supports two reporting patterns for defining variants:
</p>	
<ol>
  <li>by describing the change using HGVS or ISCN nomenclature</li>
  <li>by providing multiple component details similar to VCF columns</li>
</ol>
<p>
For each variant reporting pattern, different components MUST be used to properly define the variant where possible. Other components MAY be used to provide additional information for cross referencing external sources or increasing human readability of the instance.
</p>

<a name="NomenclatureVariants"></a>
<h4>Variants Defined by a Nomenclature Statement</h4>
<p>
This pattern describes the observed nucleotide sequence or configuration using HGVS or ISCN statement strings. Care should be taken to follow nomenclature guidelines and properly distinguish variants with the degree of precision needed for clinical use. Note that synonyms may arise within these nomenclatures so downstream validation and normalization may be required.

<h4>Manually Defined (VCF-like) Variants</h4>
<p>
This representation leverages multiple component slices to communicate an allele within the context of a specific location on a reference sequence. It is the most accurate definitional representation in FHIR, but is limited to variations with known breakpoints, and alleles should be normalized per VCF specifications. Note that VCF representations often specify genome build and chromosome identifiers rather than explicit reference sequences. Build and chromosome identifier may optionally be included for cross reference.

<h3>Contextualizing Variants</h3>
<p>Clinical context for observing the variant are often important in understanding the variant. Often, multiple tests are done to determine the values for these elements.
</p>

<p>Note that many other properties associated with contextualizing the observed variant are stored in other FHIR resources. For example, ethnicity/race/biological sex are on the Patient resource (referenced by Observation.subject) and the tissue/tumor type are on Observation.specimen.

<a name="StructuralVariants"></a>
<h3>Representing Structural Variants</h3>
<p>
The Variant profile is capable of representing a subset of structural variants (e.g. copy number variants), whereas more complex structural variants such as translocations will require additional model development. We provide guidance here on how the Variant profile can be used to communicate common structural variants.
</p>

<p>
While sources vary in how they differentiate simple vs. structural variants, here we differentiate based on end point precision and by variant length. <b>All variants with imprecise end points are treated as structural variants.</b> Variant length is more arbitrary - consider for example, a precisely located deletion of one base pair, of one thousand base pairs, of one hundred thousand base pairs. As variant length increases, it can become onerous to include REF and ALT alleles. Therefore, where end points of a variant are precisely known, users can decide whether to represent the variant as a simple or a structural variant. 
</p>

<p>
Suggested minimal representations of common structural variants are shown in the table. Data originating from NGS or DNA Chip testing will (and data originating from FISH testing will not) generally be amenable to these recommendations. HGVS representations, and any other components in the Variant profile not mentioned, can also be communicated where appropriate.

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>While a DEL is conceptually the same as a CNV with decreased copy number, and a DUP is conceptually the same as a CNV with increased copy number, in practice, different variant callers will call different structural variant types. For instance, DEL and DUP claims are generally made by breakpoint-based callers (e.g. Delly) whereas CNV claims are generally made by abundance-based callers (e.g. CNVnator). Furthermore, breakpoint-based callers generally report allelic state and/or allelic frequency whereas abundance-based callers generally report copy number.
</li>
<li>All structural variant positions are represented with outer-start-end and inner-start-end components, and not exact-start-end.
</li>
</ul>
