  <h3>Genomics Report</h3>
  <p>
    The <a href="StructureDefinition-genomics-report.html">genomics report</a> is the focus of all genomic reporting. It conveys metadata about the overall report (what kind of report it was, when it was written, who wrote it, final vs. draft, etc.). It also typically includes a rendered version for review by a clinician. It also groups together all relevant information found as part of the genomic analysis (Rules for relevancy will depend on the type of testing ordered, the reason for testing and the policies of the lab). Most of the structured genomic information is expressed as FHIR <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}observation.html">Observations</a>. Any recommendations that come with the report are expressed as FHIR <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}task.html">Tasks</a>.
  </p>

    If needed, large or complex genomic reports may be broken down into sub-reports using core DiagnosticReport extensions like <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}extension-diagnosticreport-extends.html">extends</a> or <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}extension-diagnosticreport-summaryof.html">summaryOf</a>. This is particularly useful when different labs or services are performing later steps in the analysis, for example.
  </p>
  <p>
    In some cases, the lab or other reporting organization may generate risk assessments as part of their reports. These are referenced from a report from the <a href="StructureDefinition-genomics-report-risk.html">Genomics Report Risk</a> extension.

  <h3>Genomic Observations</h3>
  <p>
    Observations are the core represention of structured genomic information. This guide defines a number of Observation profiles, with common underlying components and constraints being inherited from abstract profiles as shown in the following diagram. The profiles and their specific usage will be defined in more detail below and on the other pages of this guide.
  </p>
  <p>
    All genomic observations are derived from a <a href="StructureDefinition-genomics-base.html">common abstract profile</a> that asserts they should have a category, effective date, issued date and status.

  <a name="interpretations"> </a>
  <h4>Overall Interpretation</h4>

  <p>
    Overall interpretation is a high-level summary observation that applies to the whole report. Their purpose is to answer the question "Did you find anything when you did the test I asked you to do?"
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="StructureDefinition-overall-interpretation.html">Overall Interpretation</a> is what the laboratory declares as the summary result of the test (e.g. Positive, Negative, Unknown) and is typically used when the genomic test was looking for a particular genomically-based disease. It allows indication of whether genomic results known to be associated with the disease was found or not.
  </p>

  <a name="findings"> </a>
  <h4>Genomic Findings</h4>
  <p>The primary focus of genomic testing is making Genomic Findings. These are the fine and/or coarse-grained descriptions of a specimen's genomic characteristics. It is this information that leads to the <i>Overall Interpretations</i> for the report, as well as <a href="#implications">Genomic Implications</a> that are used to convey the potential impact of the genomic findings for the subject of the test.

    <a href="StructureDefinition-sequence-phase-relationship.html">Sequence Phase Relationship</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Genomic Findings can be subdivided into types of findings:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="StructureDefinition-genotype.html">Genotypes</a> describe combinations of genomic variations that together are associated with a particular phenotype - i.e. a specific physical, behavioral or risk-associated difference associated with the organism whose specimen was tested.</li>
    <li><a href="StructureDefinition-haplotype.html">Haplotypes</a> describe a set of genomic variations that appear on a single strand of DNA - and which are therefore typically inherited together</li>
    <li>Variants are specific differences or combinations of differences between parts of one or more specimen sequences and the equivalent portions of the reference sequence(s) for that organism. The <a href="sequencing.html">Variant Reporting</a> section deals with all types of variants detected by formal sequencing, including simple/discrete variants, structural variants and complex variants detected by direct sequencing, shotgun-based sequencing and array-based testing for specific variants.</li>
    <li><a href="StructureDefinition-sequence-phase-relationship.html">Sequence Phase Relationships</a> describe the CIS or TRANS relationship of findings.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These categories of observations have relationships. Haplotypes can be identified based on the presence of variants. Genotypes can be identified based on the presence of haplotypes and/or variants. All three can be expressed as a combination of one or more sequences.
  </p>
  <p>
    Genotype is used to convey corresponding haplotypes or variations at a particular locus. Many genotypes are expressed as simple strings, and can be conveyed in <code>genotype.valueCodeableConcept.text</code>. In some cases, genotypes are sufficiently standardized to be conveyed as codes in <code>genotype.valueCodeableConcept.code</code>.
    <ul>
      <li><code>TPMT *1/*3A</code> represents the TPMT *1 haplotype (or 'star allele') on one chromosome and the TPMT *3A haplotype on the homologous chromosome</li>
      <li><code>A/C</code> represents a heterozygous "A" and a heterozygous "C" at SNP rs1142345. </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    For HLA, KIR, and other genes in the immunogenomics domain, the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) led a community effort to define the Genotype List String (GL String) grammar, described <a href="https://glstring.org">here</a>. Notably, the GL String uses '+' as a delimiter between alleles in a genotype. It also has delimiters for ambiguous genotypes, allele lists, and haplotypes.
  </p>
  <p>
    For Pharmacogenomics, we define here a simple grammar of [HGNC gene symbol followed by white space followed by a slash ('/') delimited list of haplotype codes], where the codeSystem is set to the codeSystem of the haplotypes (e.g. Pharmvar).
  </p>
  <p>
    Here are some examples that are standardized, note that there are some other examples which still lack standardization today.

  <h4>Genomic Implications</h4>
  <blockquote class="stu-note">
    <p>
      At present, implications are noted as explicit observations about the patient/subject. However, it's not clear this is the correct approach. The work group is evaluating introducing a new resource that allows conveying "knowledge" about a variant in a patient-independent way. This would allow saying "this variant is associated with an increase risk of cardiovascular disease" rather than "based on this variant, the patient is at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease", which isn't necessarily a determination the reporting organization may wish to assert. Feedback is welcome.

  </p>
  <p>
    Genomic Implications are assertions of likely effects genomic results on the patient, tumor or other subject. Implications are relevant for areas of genomic testing including inherited disease, <a href="pharmacogenomics.html">pharmacogenomics</a> and <a href="somatics.html">somatic</a>. For inherited diseases, a <a href="StructureDefinition-diagnostic-implication.html"> diagnostic implication</a> indicates the likelihood of inheritance of a particular disease (the associated-phenotype) as well as how inheritance is likely to occur (mode-of-inheritance). For other more specific guidance, see the <a href="pharmacogenomics.html">pharmacogenomics</a> and <a href="somatics.html">somatics</a> pages.
  </p>
  <p>
    Implications inherit a common set of elements:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>genomics-artifact</code> supports conveying references to citations, supporting documentation and other information relevant to the asserted implication</li>
    <li><code>evidence-level (component)</code> indicates the strength of the evidence behind the asserted implication</li>
    <li><code>prognosis (component)</code> indicates the likely diagnostic or therapeutic outcome of the implication</li>

  <a name="grouper"> </a>
  <h4>Grouper</h4>
  <p>
    All the observations profiles defined are typically referenced directly by the <a href="StructureDefinition-genomics-report.html">genomics report</a>  However, they can also be part of a <a href="StructureDefinition-grouper.html">Grouper</a>. In this version of the specification, no guidance is provided on where or if grouper should be used. This is left up to the discretion of the reporting lab. Observations might be organized on the basis of subject, specimen, chromosome, gene, condition/disease, medication or other appropriate measure. The recursive "hasMember" relationship on grouper supports a nested tree-structure of groupers if appropriate, though more than two levels of groupers is likely excessive. See <a href="Bundle-oncologyexamples-r4.html"> an example</a> using grouper to separately reference variants and other Observations on the report.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is an example of how data could be structured with a Grouper observation:
  </p>
  <img src="general-grouper.png" alt="Example of how to use a Grouper"/>
  <p>
    Any organization of observations into groups or sub-groups is purely for navigation and presentation purposes. It carries no additional "meaning." Each observation can be interpreted on its own without knowing the associated group or sub-group and must be able to stand alone as a resource and be independently valuable. The organization of observations in groups does not assert any relationship between observations.
  </p>

  <a name="regionstudied"> </a>
  <h4>Region Studied</h4>
  <p>
    The <a href="StructureDefinition-region-studied.html">Region Studied</a> profile is used to assert actual regions studied for the performed test(s). Intended coverage areas may differ from actual coverage areas (e.g. due to technical limitations during test performance). It can assert and describe actual regions studied for the performed test(s). It can provide this description as a list at the gene level, mutation level, or as a textual description.
  </p>

  <a name="otherobservations"> </a>
  <h4>Other Observations</h4>
  <p>
    The results of tests other than genomic findings may also be included the report. One example is the <a href="StructureDefinition-tmb.html">Tumor Mutation Burden</a> profile, which captures the total number of mutations (changes) found in the DNA of cancer cells. Another example is <a href="StructureDefinition-msi.html">Microsatellite Instability</a>, a condition of genetic hypermutability that results from imparied DNA mismatch repair.
  </p>

  <a name="recommendations"> </a>
  <h3>Recommended Actions</h3>
  <p>
    These actions can be specific recommendations be taken and are driven by the results found. These can be a <a href="StructureDefinition-followup-recommendation.html">Followup Recommendation</a> which can be used to indicate when some sort of follow-up (additional testing, genetic counseling) is required, or a <a href="StructureDefinition-medication-recommendation.html">Medication Recommendation</a> which can be used to propose medication recommendations based on the results of the test.
  </p>

  <a name="contextual"> </a>
  <h3>Contextual Resources</h3>
  <p>
    There are a number of resources that are used within this guide to provide additional data as both input and output of the test.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <a href="StructureDefinition-servicerequest.html">Request for Genomic Test</a> typically represents a clinician order. It can also represent a lab-side filler order, a reflex order or even a plan or recommendation. These uses are distinguished via the <code>intent</code> element. The primary test to perform is captured in ServiceRequest.code. However, qualifications on what variants, medications, diseases and other aspects to search on can be conveyed using the <code>orderDetail</code> element. The service requests and the <a href="StructureDefinition-genomics-report.html">reports</a> resulting from them can be associated to patients, to specimens or both.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="StructureDefinition-specimen.html">Specimen</a> must be linked to a specific subject, group, or location. While genomic testing is most commonly associated with a patient, testing of a sample swabbed from a counter-top.
  </p>
  <p>
    Orders can point to other sources of information used to support the analysis performed as part of genomic testing. Genomic reports can refer to this the information that was considered as part of the report - whether provided as part of the order or made available subsequently by the patient or clinicians or otherwise retrieved. The figure above shows these relationships through the extension <a href="StructureDefinition-supporting-information.html">supportingInfo</a>, which can be to various Observations, FamilyMemberHistory records (including records that comply with <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}family-member-history-genetics.html">Family member history for genomics analysis</a> and <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}riskassessment.html">RiskAssessments</a>. 
  </p>

  <a name="relationships"> </a>
  <h3>Relationships Between Resources</h3>
  <p>
    To allow searching and appropriate navigation, the diagnostic report, observations and tasks must be able to stand on their own. They need to be related to the associated patient and/or specimen, the order that initiated the testing, the lab that performed the testing, etc. FHIR design principles dictate that these associations be present on <i>every</i> resource instance. That's because each resource could be accessed on its own as part of a query response, embedded in a document or message, passed to a decision support engine, etc. However, this is still relatively lightweight because the information is included by reference only.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following diagram shows the relationships between the diagnostic report, observations and other elements used in the profile. Note that there is no expectation that all relationships will point to the same instances. In special cases, a genomic report may involve multiple patients or multiple specimens.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Figure 4: Relationships Between Resources</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Key points to take from this diagram:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Of the different types of observations, Genomic Findings all have exactly one specimen. The remainder might be associated with a specimen, but might not. Observations may also be associated with a particular BodyStructure, such as a fetus, tumor or lesion.</li>
    <li>Genomic reports and observations can be tied to multiple "orders" - this is because each test requested is handled as a separate request. All tests ordered as part of a single requisition are linked by the <code>requisition</code> identifier.</li>
    <li><i>Overall Interpretations</i> should be "derived from" <i>Genomic Findings</i>. For example, the report might want to be flagged as a 'Positive' report, and can reference the specific findings that lead to that interpretation.</li>
    <li><i>Genomic Implications</i> should be "derived from" <i>Genomic Findings</i>. For example, in a genomic report, it's not acceptable to imply "patient is an increased metabolizer of drug X" without also indicating the variant, haplotype or genotype found that supports that implication.</li>
    <li><i>Recommended Actions</i> are referenced from the <a href="StructureDefinition-recommended-action.html">Recommended Action</a> extension. These Task resources will also have relationships to Genomic Implications or other observations.</li>
  </ul>
