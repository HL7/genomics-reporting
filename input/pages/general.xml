    This page defines the core profiles and concepts that would be expected to be present in most genomic reports, regardless of type, and how those profiles relate to each other. Concepts covered include the genomic report itself and the high-level categories of observations and other elements that make up the report, such as patient, specimen, variants, haplotypes, genotypes, etc.

  <h3>Genomic Report</h3>
  <p>
    The <a href="StructureDefinition-genomic-report.html">genomic report</a> is the focus of all genomic reporting. It conveys metadata about the overall report (what kind of report it was, when it was written, who wrote it, final vs. draft, etc.). It also typically includes a rendered version for review by a clinician. It also groups together all relevant information found as part of the genomic analysis (Rules for relevancy will depend on the type of testing ordered, the reason for testing and the policies of the lab). Most of the structured genomic information is expressed as FHIR <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}observation.html">Observations</a>. Any recommendations that come with the report are expressed as FHIR <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}task.html">Tasks</a>. The report can be organized into sub-reports using core DiagnosticReport extensions like <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}extension-diagnosticreport-extends.html">extends</a> or <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}extension-diagnosticreport-summaryof.html">summaryOf</a>, which is especially useful for later analysis steps. Additionally, an observation can be used to <a href="groupingGuidance.html">group</a> content for viewing purposes or to indicate a higher-level panel (with a specific LOINC panel code in the <code>Observation.code</code> for example).

  <p>
    <b>Genomic Report Overview</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="StructureDefinition-genomic-report.html">Genomic Report</a>,
    <a href="#findings">Genomic Findings</a>,
    <a href="#implications">Genomic Implications</a>,
    <!--<a href="#grouper">Grouper</a>,-->
    <a href="#genomicstudy">Genomic Study</a>,
    <a href="#recommendations">Recommended Actions</a>
  </p>
  <a name="interpretations"> </a>
  <p>
    On the report, it is important to answer the question "Did you find anything when you did the test I asked you to do?" The data sender can use attributes of <code>conclusionCode</code> and <code>conclusion</code> to represent the summary result of the test (e.g., Positive, Negative, Unknown) and a textual summary. These are typically used when the genomic test was looking for a particular genomically-based disease. It allows indication of whether genomic results known to be associated with the disease were found or not.
  </p>
   <p>
    Results observation profiles, like genomic observations, are typically referenced directly by a Genomic Report. The genetic findings and implication profiles all contain links to computably define their composite relationships (e.g., the variant observation is referenced within the implication profile using <code>derivedFrom</code>). However, observations could be organized into groups by other observations. See this <a href="groupingGuidance.html">grouping guidance</a> for an overview with examples and considerations for processing reports. Be aware that consumers of Genomic Diagnostic Report MUST navigate through all <code>hasMember</code> relations and navigate through <code>derivedFrom</code> relationships to ensure processing of all clinically relevant information.
   </p>
  <p>
    When sending a copy of the report (e.g., PDF or other document containing the written report), use <code>presentedForm</code>. Note this is different from the <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}extension-workflow-relatedartifact.html">Related Artifact</a> extension, which is used to reference citations, evidence and other supporting documentation for the observation or report. Another approach which should be avoided (at least for this current release) is the <code>DiagnosticReport.media</code> attribute. Its definition focuses on "Key images associated with this report" which does not align well with this use case.
  </p>
  <p>
   If needed, large or complex genomic reports may be broken down into sub-reports using core DiagnosticReport extensions like <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}extension-diagnosticreport-extends.html">extends</a> or <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}extension-diagnosticreport-summaryof.html">summaryOf</a>. This approach is particularly useful when different labs or services are performing later steps in the analysis, for example. Or a panel <code>Observation.code</code> can be used.
  </p>
  <p>
    In some cases, the lab or other reporting organization may generate risk assessments as part of their reports. These are referenced from a report or an observation from the <a href="StructureDefinition-genomic-risk-assessment.html">Genomic Risk</a> extension.
  </p>

  <a name="genomicstudy"> </a>
  <h3>Genomic Study</h3>
    <p>
     In the R5 release, the <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/genomicstudy.html">GenomicStudy resource</a> was introduced. This resource is intended at capturing relevant information about the reasons, purpose, and performers of the study. It also provides technical endpoints to access the data. It could be a logical aggregator for complex analyses.
    </p>
    <p>
     These features are important to appropriately manage and structure the metadata about a genomic study. As such, this guide has introduced new profiles to 'backport' these features for this R4 based implementation guide. Refer to these profiles for additional details:
     <p><a href="StructureDefinition-genomic-study.html">GenomicStudy profile</a> to represent the study level metadata.</p>
     <p><a href="StructureDefinition-genomic-study-analysis.html">GenomicStudyAnalysis profile</a> to represent the analysis level metadata.</p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The <code>GenomicStudy</code> instance SHOULD be referenced from a <a href="#diagnosticreport">report</a> and CAN be referenced by various <a href="#observations">observations</a>.
    </p>

    <a name="fileattachments"> </a>
    <h4>Attaching Genomic Files</h4>
    <blockquote class="stu-note">
      <p>
        The guidance below for file attachments needs to be carefully reviewed and considered. There are potential issues, and the Work Group welcomes feedback.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      While this implementation guide strives to provide structured genomic data via a variety of <a href="#observations">observations</a>, there are use cases that warrant a deeper level of data than this guide allows. These use cases might be best served by sending commonly used files (VCF, BAM, CRAM, MAF, BED to name a few) with the genomic study. To promote a consistent approach to sharing these files, we provide the guidance in this section. Even with this guidance, note that best practices in exchanging these files along with the metadata necessary to make use of them through a FHIR API, remains a complicated and open issue. See <a href="operations.html">operations</a> for a description of an experimental alternative workflow.
    </p>
    <p>
      When sending these genomic files, implementers should first utilize the <a href="#genomicstudy">Genomic Study</a> profiles. Each study has one or more analyses, each of which can define <code>input</code> and <code>output</code> elements. From there, the <a href="StructureDefinition-genomic-data-file.html">GenomicDataFile</a> can be used to send the file content along with meaningful metadata. This approach allows the files to have their own existence and enables queries to find them via the <code>DocumentReference</code> resource. To enable linking from the report to files, the <a href="StructureDefinition-genomic-study-reference.html">Genomic Study Reference</a> extension can be used to reference the study, corresponding analyses, and then the files. This can be helpful for those processing the report to easily identify the files that were sent along with the report.
    </p>
    <p>
      When sending genomic files there are many considerations. For example, it is not unusual for files to be gigabytes in size. The <code>DocumentReference</code> resource has different options to evaluate for your use case. If embedded directly using <code>DocumentReference.content.attachment.data</code>, servers receiving the files may have size constraints per resource or per transaction which may limit your options. Instead of sending a large data file, the file can be referenced by a URL and title using the <code>DocumentReference.content.attachment.url</code> element. This can point to an online resource that hosts the file or from where the file can be accessed. For genomic files, the host is likely not the FHIR server providing the <code>DocumentReference</code> data instance. Be aware that use of <code>DocumentReference</code> to provide access to files through URLs introduces authorization requirements that are out of scope of this Implementation Guide. With either of these approaches, it is important to note the files might be compressed. Also, the mime types for these genomic files will vary, or possibly be missing. The senders of the data should include as much metadata as possible to enable the receiver to appropriately handle the files.
    </p>
    <p>
      For receivers to make use of these files, many facets of the generation of the files will be needed, such as what pipelines, tools, and settings were used. The intended downstream use cases must be carefully evaluated to ensure appropriate file preparation. The <a href="StructureDefinition-genomic-study-analysis.html">Genomic Study Analysis</a> defines a number of attributes that can be used to better understand the file. Also, the <code>DocumentReference.description</code> might be helpful for a sending system to provide guidance on how the file was generated. A fully computable approach for this issue has yet to be defined.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be noted that this <code>Genomic Study</code> approach is <i>not</i> an appropriate way to send a copy of the report (e.g., PDF or other document containing the written report). Instead, use <code>DiagnosticReport.presentedForm</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A full, detailed implementation discussion is outside the scope of this IG. In a future release, this IG may include other profiles or artifacts along with more specific guidance.

  <a name="observations"> </a>
  <h3>Genomic Observations</h3>
  <p>
    Observations are the core representation of structured genomic information. This guide defines a number of Observation profiles, with common underlying components and constraints being inherited from abstract profiles as shown in the following diagram. The profiles and their specific usage will be defined in more detail below and on the other pages of this guide.
  </p>
  <p>
    All genomic observations are derived from a <a href="StructureDefinition-genomic-base.html">common abstract profile</a> that asserts they should have a category, effective date, issued date and status.

  <h4>Genomic Findings</h4>
  <p>
    The primary focus of genomic testing is making Genomic Findings. These are the fine and/or coarse-grained descriptions of a specimen's genomic characteristics. It is this information that leads to the <code>GenomicReport.conclusion</code> and <code>GenomicReport.conclusionCode</code> for the report, as well as <a href="#implications">Genomic Implications</a> that are used to convey the potential impact of the genomic findings for the subject of the test.
  </p>
  <img src="general-genomic-findings.png" alt="Class diagram showing relationship of genomic findings as well as genotypes, haplotypes, variants and sequences."  width="522" height="325"/>
  <p>
    <b>Genomic Findings</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="StructureDefinition-finding.html">Genomic Finding</a>,
    <a href="StructureDefinition-genotype.html">Genotype</a>,
    <a href="StructureDefinition-haplotype.html">Haplotype</a>,
    <a href="StructureDefinition-variant.html"> Variant</a> (or see <a href="sequencing.html">Variant Reporting</a>),
    <a href="StructureDefinition-sequence-phase-relationship.html">Sequence Phase Relationship</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Genomic Findings can be subdivided into types of findings:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="StructureDefinition-genotype.html">Genotypes</a> describe combinations of genomic variations that together are associated with a particular phenotype - i.e., a specific physical, behavioral, or risk-associated difference associated with the organism whose specimen was tested.</li>
    <li><a href="StructureDefinition-haplotype.html">Haplotypes</a> describe a set of genomic variations that appear on a single strand of DNA - and which are therefore typically inherited together</li>
    <li>Variants are specific differences or combinations of differences between parts of one or more specimen sequences and the equivalent portions of the reference sequence(s) for that organism. The <a href="sequencing.html">Variant Reporting</a> section deals with all types of variants detected by formal sequencing, including simple/discrete variants, structural variants and complex variants detected by direct sequencing, shotgun-based sequencing, and array-based testing for specific variants.</li>
    <li><a href="StructureDefinition-sequence-phase-relationship.html">Sequence Phase Relationships</a> describe the CIS or TRANS relationship of findings.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These categories of observations have relationships. Haplotypes can be identified based on the presence of variants. Genotypes can be identified based on the presence of haplotypes and/or variants. All three can be expressed as a combination of one or more sequences.
  </p>

  <a name="implications"> </a>
  <h4>Genomic Implications</h4>
  <blockquote class="stu-note">
    <p>
      At present, implications are noted as explicit observations about the patient/subject. However, it's not clear this is the correct approach. The work group is evaluating introducing a new resource that allows conveying "knowledge" about a variant in a patient-independent way. This would allow saying "this variant is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease" rather than "based on this variant, the patient is at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease", which isn't necessarily a determination the reporting organization may wish to assert. Feedback is welcome.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <img src="general-genomic-implications.png" alt="Class diagram showing relationship of genomic implications." width="639" height="365"/>
  <p>
    <b>Genomic Implications</b>

    Genomic Implications are assertions of likely effects of genomic results on the patient, tumor, or other subject. Implications are relevant for areas of genomic testing including inherited disease, <a href="pharmacogenomics.html">pharmacogenomics</a> and <a href="somatics.html">somatic</a>. For inherited diseases, a <a href="StructureDefinition-diagnostic-implication.html"> diagnostic implication</a> indicates the likelihood of inheritance of a particular disease (the associated-phenotype) as well as how inheritance is likely to occur (mode-of-inheritance). For other more specific guidance, see the <a href="pharmacogenomics.html">pharmacogenomics</a> and <a href="somatics.html">somatics</a> pages.
  </p>
 
  <a name="biomarkers"> </a>
  <h4>Molecular Biomarkers</h4>
  <p>
    The term 'biomarker' is broad, encompassing observable characteristics that indicate normal or abnormal biological processes and that are often used to assess prognosis or guide therapy. In the broad sense, many clinical and laboratory observations might be considered a 'biomarker'. 'Molecular biomarker' is likewise broad, primarily encompassing laboratory measurements of human inherent substances such as gene products, antigens and antibodies, complex chemicals that result from post-translational processing of multi-gene products, etc. Molecular biomarkers include many different types of measurements, such as presence or absence of a chemical, or the level of a chemical. Here, we are primarily interested in those molecular biomarkers that have associated therapeutic implications, particularly in precision cancer care, including but not limited to: cell receptor levels (e.g. ER, PR, HER2); molecular sequence adjacent observations (e.g. microsatellite instability, tumor mutation burden, gene promoter methylation); cell receptor ligands (e.g. PD-L1); proteins, antigens, and antibodies (e.g. HLA type). These sorts of observations may be represented by the <a href="StructureDefinition-molecular-biomarker.html">Molecular Biomarker</a> profile.
  </p>

  <a name="recommendations"> </a>
  <h3>Recommended Actions</h3>
  <p>
    These actions can be specific recommendations be taken and are driven by the results found. These can be a <a href="StructureDefinition-followup-recommendation.html">Follow-up Recommendation</a> which can be used to indicate when some sort of follow-up (additional testing, genetic counseling) is required, or a <a href="StructureDefinition-medication-recommendation.html">Medication Recommendation</a> which can be used to propose medication recommendations based on the results of the test.
  </p>

  <a name="contextual"> </a>
  <h3>Contextual Resources</h3>
  <p>
    There are a number of resources that are used within this guide to provide additional data as both input and output of the test.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}servicerequest.html">ServiceRequest</a> resource typically represents a clinician order. It can also represent a lab-side filler order, a reflex order or even a plan or recommendation. These uses are distinguished via the <code>intent</code> element. The primary test to perform is captured in <code>ServiceRequest.code</code>. However, qualifications on what variants, medications, diseases, and other aspects to search on can be conveyed using the <code>orderDetail</code> element. The service requests and the <a href="StructureDefinition-genomic-report.html">reports</a> resulting from them can be associated to patients, to specimens or both.
  </p>
  <p>
    Orders can point to other sources of information used to support the analysis performed as part of genomic testing. Genomic reports can refer to information that was considered as part of the report - whether provided as part of the order or made available subsequently by the patient or clinicians or otherwise retrieved. The figure above shows these relationships through the extension <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}extension-workflow-supportinginfo.html">SupportingInformation</a>, which can be to any resource but would typically reference  Observations, FamilyMemberHistory records (including records that comply with <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}family-member-history-genetics.html">Family member history for genomics analysis</a> and <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}riskassessment.html">RiskAssessments</a>. 
  </p>

  <a name="relationships"> </a>
  <h3>Relationships Between Resources</h3>
  <p>
    To allow searching and appropriate navigation, the diagnostic report, observations, and tasks must be able to stand on their own. They need to be related to the associated patient and/or specimen, the order that initiated the testing, the lab that performed the testing, etc. FHIR design principles dictate that these associations be present on <i>every</i> resource instance. That's because each resource could be accessed on its own as part of a query response, embedded in a document or message, passed to a decision support engine, etc. However, this is still relatively lightweight because the information is included by reference only.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following diagram shows the relationships between the diagnostic report, observations, and other elements used in the profile. Note that there is no expectation that all relationships will point to the same instances. In special cases, a genomic report may involve multiple patients or multiple specimens. As mentioned, the <code>extends</code>, <code>summaryOf</code> can be used well to provide additional organization.
  </p>
  <img src="general-relationships.png" alt="Class diagram showing the interrelationships between DiagnosticReport, Observation, Task, Patient, Specimen, etc."/>
  <p>
    Key points to take from this diagram:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Of the different types of observations, Genomic Findings are expected to have one specimen. The remainder might be associated with a specimen, but might not. Observations may also be associated with a particular BodyStructure, such as a fetus, tumor, or lesion.</li>
    <li>Genomic reports and observations can be tied to multiple "orders" - this is because each test requested is handled as a separate request. All tests ordered as part of a single requisition are linked by the <code>requisition</code> identifier.</li>
    <li><i>Genomic Study</i> SHOULD be linked from <code>GenomicReport</code> and CAN be linked from <code>Observations</code>. Genomic Study can reference multiple Genomic Study Analysis instances, which can reference input and output files.</li>
    <li><i>Genomic Implications</i> observations should be linked to <i>Genomic Findings</i> observations using the <code>Observation.derivedFrom</code> attribute. For example, in a genomic report, it's not acceptable to imply "patient is an increased metabolizer of drug X" without also indicating the variant, haplotype or genotype found that supports that implication.</li>
    <li><i>Recommended Actions</i> are referenced from the <a href="StructureDefinition-recommended-action.html">Recommended Action</a> extension. These Task resources will also have relationships to Genomic Implications or other observations.</li>
  </ul>

	<a name="Grouping observations"> </a>
	<h3>Referencing Observations from GenomicReport</h3>
	<p>
		The following is derived from the CORE FHIR guidance on <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}diagnosticreport.html#10.3.5.3">Diagnostic Report Resource</a> and <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}observation.html#obsgrouping">Observation Resource</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		For receivers of genetic reports, to ensure all clinically relevant information is processed, consumers of Genomic Diagnostic reports MUST navigate through all hasMember relations, and navigate through derivedFrom when processing Genomic Diagnostic reports.
	</p>
	<p>
		For senders of Genomic Diagnostic reports, it is up to receiving systems to arrange/use the genomic observations appropriately. However, some systems may only process just the first layer of a <code>DiagnosticReport.results</code>. Thus, when sending the report and results, we recommend including result links to all the genomic observation results being returned. For more complex reporting use cases, consider using the <code>summaryOf</code> extension on <code>DiagnosticReport</code> for creating meaningful subsets of observations.
	</p>
	
  <a name="querynote"> </a>
  <h3>Querying</h3>
  <p>
	As a note on querying, the relationships indicated by <code>hasMember</code>, <code>derivedFrom</code> and the computable meaning conveyed by observation.code and component.code are critical for specificity in querying and getting comprehensive search results. Additionally, values found in elements like component.value and observation.value are useful as well. However, the meanings of the values are predicated on by the component.code or observation.code to which they associate. There is a page in this IG with <a href="usecases.html">query guidance</a> that shows how to use components, relationships (references) and the iterative <code>hasMember</code> to find results. The use of a grouping observation does not influence the ability to query. For example, the profile of a variant contains a value for the gene name component. Querying for all variants for the patient in a given gene can be done through the gene name component.
  </p>
  
  <a name="flexibility"></a>
  <h3>Additional Structured Data</h3>
  <p>
    This Implementation Guide uses <a hef="{{site.data.fhir.path}}profiling.html">FHIR profiling</a> to define constraints on base resources to provide an interoperable structure for reporting structured genomic data. While this guide seeks to fully describe concepts necessary for a complete genomics report, there might be other data to be considered. Here are ways and examples where flexibility might be needed:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data attributes related to existing profiles: e.g. unique variant or biomarker annotations</li>
    <li>New concepts not represented by profiles: e.g. panel observations for grouping results</li>
    <li>Building relationships between concepts not represented by profiles: e.g. panel observations referenced from a report</li>
    <li>Coded values not in referenced ValueSets: e.g. lab specific codes for level of evidence</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The data in question might be represented in this guide in a different way, so implementers SHALL carefully review this guide. Every deviation from this guide makes implementations less consistent and therefore less interoperable. The Clinical Genomics working group welcomes questions and will assist with appropriate usage of this guide. The group will make corrections and enhancments to this guide that benefits the broader community. All this said, we recognize it will be likely for some implementers to exercise this flexibility, so here is additional guidance on the appropriate options.
  </p>

  <a name="custom extensions"></a>
  <h4>Custom Extensions</h4>
  <p>
    This guide introduces a number of extensions where an attribute was identified as important to report genomic data, but other extensions can be introduced for specific implementations. Implementers may use the <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}extensibility.html">extensibility</a> features built into FHIR.
  </p>

  <a name="open slicing"></a>
  <h4>Open Slicing</h4>
  <p>
    When constraining attributes that can contain multiple values, the FHIR concept of <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}profiling.html#slicing">slicing</a> is used. The slices defined are all 'open' which means that while the specific rules should be used when possible, implementers are free to send additional data.
  </p>

  <p>
    The guide requires specific codes in some cases, but other codes (like lab specific codes) are still allowed. For example, in <code>Observation.code</code>, profiles require a specific code be sent, but allows other codes in <code>Observation.code.coding</code>, as long implementations meet the rules for "Additional Codes" found <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}datatypes.html#CodeableConcept">here</a>
  </p> 

  <p>
    In <code>Observation.component</code>, additional supporting results can be described in <code>Observation.component.code</code> and a value delivered in <code>Observation.component.value[x]</code>. When considering additional components, review the grouping guidance for components <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}observation.html#gr-comp">here</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For references between resources, the guide defines slices to indicate the type of resources we suggest referencing. However references to other resources, if allowed in the base specification, are still valid. For example, in the <a href="StructureDefinition-genomic-report.html">Genomic Report</a>, the <code>result</code> element is sliced by the variety of Observation profiles defined in this guide. When additional Observations are used, they should still be referenced by <code>result</code> to ensure all instances can be easily discovered.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Specifically for references between Observations, there are two attributes for defining relationships between instances. For additional guidance on appropriately using <code>hasMember</code> and <code>derivedFrom</code>, please see <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}observation.html#gr-other">here</a>.

  <h4>Binding Strength</h4>
  <p>
    When the guide references a ValueSet, a <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}terminologies.html#strength">binding strength</a> indicates the flexibility implementers have in choosing codes. With few exeptions, the guide defines bindings that allow implementers flexibility to select other codes when the indicated ValueSet does not have an appropriate code. Implementers should align codes with those suggested by the guide when possible.
