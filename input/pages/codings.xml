    <p>Genomics covers a broad landscape involving many organizations outside of HL7 that have established codes and name systems for different use cases. The <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TA">HL7 Terminology Authority (HTA)</a> governs the use of terminologies that are external to HL7 and they have begun to document these. As a part of the <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG">Terminology Services Management Group</a>, the HTA is working with these organizations to establish canonical URIs that can be used as HL7 code and name systems. HL7 has established <a href="https://terminology.hl7.org">terminology.hl7.org (THO)</a> as the authoritative source for code system information, including <a href="https://terminology.hl7.org/external_terminologies.html">external terminologies</a> Many of these are also listed in <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}terminologies-systems.html">the core specification guidance</a>.</p>
    <p>We have listed many, but not all, of genomics-related systems below. In this table, we provide links for more information -- to the THO or HTA entries when available, or to the organization home page if not. We also list a URI that has been approved by the THO/HTA or by <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/VOC/Vocabulary+Work+Group">Vocabulary Work Group</a>, and a coding system label defined in the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=279">HL7 Version 2.5.1 Implementation Guide: Laboratory Results Interface</a> (LRI).</p>

However, it now also includes large structural variants, which have a known clinical implication. So now simple, complex and many structural variants can all be found in ClinVar. The ClinVar records have a field for Allele ID and for Variant ID. We focus on the variant ID in this guide. This coding system uses the variant ID as the code and the variant name from NCBI’s "variant_summary.txt.gz" file as the code’s print string. The "variant_summary.txt.gz" file caries more than 20 useful fields, including the separate components of the variant name, the cytogenetic location, the genomic reference, etc. So based on the Variant ID, you can use ClinVar to find most you would ever want to know about the variant. In the LHC Clinical Table Search Service and LHC-Forms, we have indexed many of these attributes to assist users and applications that need to find the ID for a particular variant.</td>

Accordingly, we have divided the coding system for dbVar the same way. This coding system represents the Germline dbVar variants. Its record ID may begin with one of four prefixes: nsv, nssv, esv and essv. These are accession prefixes for variant regions (nsv) and variant calls (or instances, nssv), respectively. Typically, one or more variant instances (nssv – variant calls based directly on experimental evidence) are merged into one variant region (nsv – a pair of start-stop coordinates reflecting the submitters’ assertion of the region of the genome that is affected by the variant instances). The “n” preceding sv or indicates that the variants were submitted to NCBI (dbVar). The prefix, “e” for esv and essv represent variant entities (corresponding to NCBI’s nsv and nssv) that were submitted to EBI (DGVa). The relation between variant call, and variant region, instances is many to one. The LHC lookup table for dbVar germline variations includes both variant instances (essv or nssv) and the variant region records (nsv, esv).

GL String grammar is a string format for genotyping results from genetic systems with defined nomenclatures, such as HLA and KIR. In addition to genotyping results, the grammar can also describe data analysis artifacts such as multi-locus (multi-gene) haplotypes. From a terminology standpoint, the result of adding a compositional grammar to an established code system such as HLA or KIR nomenclature is a new code system, because the grammar may be used to construct expressions not explicitly defined in the original system as concept codes.</td>

The HGNC-Symb table provided by HUGO carries only human genes and is available in a table by LHC. The code for this coding system is the HGNC gene code, the "name" or print string is the HGNC gene symbol. More than 28,000 human gene symbols and names have been assigned so far, including almost all of the protein coding genes. NCBI creates what might be thought of as interim codes. Older systems might send HGNC gene IDs without the "HGNC:" prefix. This is not following the guidance of the creators of the code system, and introduces ambiguity.

A subset of these are commonly used as markers for histocompatibility testing for stem cell and solid organ transplantation, drug sensitivity, and disease association. The WHO Nomenclature Committee for Factors of the HLA System is responsible for a common nomenclature of HLA alleles, allele sequences, and quality control, to communicate histocompatibility typing information to match donors and recipients. An HLA allele is defined as any set of variations found on a sequence of DNA comprising a HLA gene. So, if there are five variations found in this one gene sequence, this set is defined as one allele (vs. the definition of an allele being the variation found between the test specimen and the reference along a contiguous stretch of DNA). In the case of HLA, the contiguous stretch of DNA represents the entire gene, and the variations do not need to be contiguous within the gene sequence. Each HLA allele name has a unique name consisting of the gene name followed by up to four fields, each containing at least two digits, separated by colons. There are also optional suffixes added to indicate expression status. Individual HLA genes may have thousands of different alleles. For the full specification, please go to this website: http://hla.alleles.org/nomenclature/naming.html. HLA nomenclature can also be used to represent sets of alleles that share sequence identity in the Antigen Recognition Site (ARS). G-groups are alleles that have identical DNA sequences in the ARS, while P-groups are alleles that have identical protein sequences in the ARS. These are described, respectively, in <a href="http://hla.alleles.org/alleles/g_groups.html">http://hla.alleles.org/alleles/g_groups.html</a> and <a href="http://hla.alleles.org/alleles/p_groups.html">http://hla.alleles.org/alleles/p_groups.html</a>.</td>

This has resulted in a proliferation of mappings between disease entries in different resources; however mappings are problematic: collectively, they are expensive to create and maintain. Most importantly, the mappings lack completeness, accuracy, and precision; as a result, mapping calls are often inconsistent between resources. The UMLS provides intermediate concepts through which other resources can be mapped, but these mappings suffer from the same challenges: they are not guaranteed to be one-to-one, especially in areas with evolving disease concepts such as rare disease.</td>

A star allele can identify either a single variant or a group of variants found in cis, and therefore it usually represents a haplotype. A star allele name is composed of the gene symbol and an allele number, separated by an asterisk, e.g. TPMT*2. By convention, the *1 allele represents the allele that contains the "reference" sequence, although that is not true in all cases. Closely related alleles may be assigned a common number and be differentiated by a unique letter that specifies the suballele (e.g., TPMT*3A, TPMT*3B). Pharmacogenomics tests commonly report patient phenotypes as diplotypes, i.e. *1/*3A. The star nomenclature system is inadequately defined and inconsistently adopted. Therefore, although the system we are proposing supports the inclusion of pharmacogenomics star alleles as a legacy syntax, we strongly encourage messages that include star alleles to rigorously define those alleles through other means.</td>
