### HL7 v2 Integration {#v2}

Most laboratory reporting in the world that is exchanged over a standards-based interface is shared using the HL7 v2 standard. HL7 has published two implementation guides advising on how to share genomic reporting information using HL7 v2:

- [v2 Genetic Variation Model Implementation Guide](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=23)
- [v2 Cytogenetic Model Implementation Guide](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=364)
