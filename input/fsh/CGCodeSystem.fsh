CodeSystem: SequencePhaseRelationshipCS
Title: "Sequence Phase Relationship"
Description: "Code System for specific types of relationships"

* #Cis "Cis" "Phase is in cis (same chromosome)"
* #Trans "Trans" "Phase is in trans (different chromosomes)"
* #Indeterminate "Indeterminate" "Phase is unable to be determined"
* #Unknown "Unknown" "Phase is unknown"

CodeSystem: TbdCodes
Title: "ToBeDeterminedCodes ('TbdCodes')"
Description: "These codes are currently 'TBD-LOINC' codes. The CG WG is requesting formal LOINC codes."

* #grouper "grouper" "A means to bundle several observations such as one would find in a genetics test panel."
* #effect-transporter-function "effect-transporter-function" "Predicted phenotype for drug efficacy through transport mechanism. A single marker interpretation value known to increase or decrease the drug's performance."
* #effect-medication-efficacy "Medication Efficacy"
* #effect-medication-metabolism "Medication Metabolism"
* #effect-medication-transporter "Medication Transporter Function"
* #effect-high-risk-allele "High Risk Allele"
* #prognostic-implication "Prognostic Implication component" "Finding of whether a particular somatic genotype/haplotype/variation or combination-thereof predicts a particular outcome for the specified cancer - either on its own or in conjunction with one or more interventions."
* #associated-cancer "associated-cancer"
* #associated-therapy "Genomically linked therapy" "The non-medication therapy (procedure) associated with this implication."
* #region-coverage "region-coverage" "Given as a number between 0 and 100. Mean mapped read depth. Obtained by counting total number of mapped reads and divided by the number of bases in the region sequence."
* #molecular-consequence "Molecular Consequence" "Annotated changes to sequence features caused by this variant. Terms are from the sequence ontology under SO:0001537."
* #exact-start-end "Variant exact start and end" "The genomic coordinates of the exact genomic range in which the variant resides."
* #inner-start-end "Variant inner start and end" "The genomic coordinates of the inner genomic range in which the variant might reside."
* #outer-start-end "Variant outer start and end" "The genomic coordinates of the outer genomic range in which the variant might reside."
* #variant-inheritance "Variant inheritance" "A quality inhering in a variant by virtue of its origin. The terms are in the sequence ontology under SO:0001762."
* #diagnostic-implication "Diagnostic Implication" "An observation linking a genomic finding with a knowledge base, providing context that may aid in diagnosing a patient with a particular phenotype or condition."
* #therapeutic-implication "Therapeutic Implication" "An observation linking a genomic finding with a knowledge base, providing potential evidence of an interaction with a specified medication or non-medicinal therapy."
* #uncallable-region "Uncallable Region" "A contiguous region where a call was not made. Must be inside the range given by 'ranges examined' in the given reference sequence and coordinate system."
* #functional-effect "The effect of a variant on downstream biological products or pathways (from Sequence Ontology)."
