    <td>ClinVar processes submissions reporting variants found in patient samples, assertions made regarding their clinical significance, information about the submitter, and other supporting data. The alleles described in submissions are mapped to reference sequences, and reported according to the HGVS standard. ClinVar includes simple and complex variants composed of multiple small variants. However, it now also includes large structural variants, which have a known clinical implication. So now simple, complex and many structural variants can all be found in ClinVar. The ClinVar records have a field for Allele ID and for Variant ID. All simple variants have an Allele ID. At present, all complex and most simple variants also have a Variant ID, and by the end of 2016, all simple variants will also have a variant ID. We focus mostly on the variant ID in this guide. This coding system uses the variant ID as the code and the variant name from NCBI’s "variant_summary.txt.gz" file as the code’s print string. The "variant_summary.txt.gz" file caries more than 20 useful fields, including the separate components of the variant name, the cytogenetic location, the genomic reference, etc. So based on the Variant ID, you can use ClinVar to find most you would ever want to know about the variant. In the LHC Clinical Table Search Service and LHC-Forms, we have indexed many of these attributes to assist users and applications that need to find the ID for a particular variant.</td>

It consists of three parts: the Chromosome number (e.g. 1-22, X, Y), an indicator of which arm – either “p” for the short or “q” for the long, and then generally a series of numbers separated by dots that indicate the region and any applicable band, sub-band, and sub-sub-band of the locus (e.g. 2p16.3). There are other conventions for reporting ranges and locations at the ends of the chromosomes. The table of these chromosome locations was loaded with all of the locations found in NCBI’s ClinVar variation tables. It will expand as additional sources become available. This does not include all finely grained chromosome locations that exist. Users can add to it as needed.</td>

Accordingly, we have divided the codingsystem for dbVar the same way. This coding system represents the Germline dbVar variants. Its record ID maybegin with one of four prefixes: nsv, nssv, esv and essv.These are accession prefixes for variant regions (nsv) and variant calls (or instances, nssv), respectively. Typically,one or more variant instances (nssv – variant calls based directly on experimental evidence) are merged into onevariant region (nsv – a pair of start-stop coordinates reflecting the submitters’ assertion of the region of thegenome that is affected by the variant instances). The “n” preceding sv or indicates that the variants weresubmitted to NCBI (dbVar). The prefix, “e” for esv and essv represent variant entities (corresponding to NCBI’s nsvand nssv) that were submitted to EBI (DGVa). The relation between variant call, and variant region, instances ismany to one.The LHC lookup table for dbVar germline variations includes both variant instances (essv or nssv) and the variantregion records (nsv, esv). Users can sub-select by searching on the appropriate prefix.</td>

HLA alleles are most commonly used for histocompatibility testing for stem cell and solid organtransplantation. The WHO Nomenclature Committee for Factors of the HLA System is responsible for a commonnomenclature of HLA alleles, allele sequences, and quality control, to communicate histocompatibility typinginformation to match donors and recipients.An HLA allele is defined as any set of variations found on a sequence of DNA comprising a HLA gene. So, if thereare five variations found in this one gene sequence, this set is defined as one allele (vs. the definition of an allelebeing the variation found between the test specimen and the reference along a contiguous stretch of DNA). In thecase of HLA, the contiguous stretch of DNA represents the entire gene, and the variations do not need to becontiguous within the gene sequence.Each HLA allele name has a unique name consisting of the gene name followed by up to four fields, eachcontaining at least two digits, separated by colons. There are also optional suffixes added to indicate expressionstatus. For the full specification, please go to this website: http://hla.alleles.org/nomenclature/naming.html.HLA nomenclature can also be used to represent sets of alleles that share sequence identity in the AntigenRecognition Site (ARS). G-groups are alleles that have identical DNA sequences in the ARS, while P-groups arealleles that have identical protein sequences in the ARS. These are described, respectively, inhttp://hla.alleles.org/alleles/g_groups.html and http://hla.alleles.org/alleles/p_groups.html .</td>

    <td>The star allele nomenclature is commonly used in pharmacogenomics as shorthand to specify one or morespecific variants in a gene that is known to impact drug metabolism or response. A star allele can identify either asingle variant or a group of variants found in cis, and therefore it usually represents a haplotype.A star allele name is composed of the gene symbol and an allele number, separated by an asterisk, e.g. TPMT*2.By convention, the *1 allele represents the allele that contains the "reference" sequence, although that is not truein all cases. Closely related alleles may be assigned a common number and be differentiated by a unique letterthat specifies the suballele (e.g., TPMT*3A, TPMT*3B). Pharmacogenomics tests commonly report patientphenotypes as diplotypes, i.e. *1/*3A.The star nomenclature system is inadequately defined and inconsistently adopted. Therefore, although the systemwe are proposing supports the inclusion of pharmacogenomics star alleles as a legacy syntax, we stronglyencourage messages that include star alleles to rigorously define those alleles in Report Section 5, Glossary forHaplotype Definition, which allows the reporting lab to specify the variants with their local definitions.</td>
