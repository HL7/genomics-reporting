    The <b>Described Variant</b> has a large number of properties.  However these properties fall into groups, where each group of properties has a purpose (and in some cases represents information that typically appears together).  The groups of properties are described below:
  </p>
  
  <a name="location"> </a>
  <h3>Location properties</h3>
  <p>
    These are properties that help to describe <i>where</i> a particular variation occurs.  Some are common for all computable findings (genotypes, haplotypes, described and complex variants).  Some appear on the <a href="sequence.html">Sequence profile</a> as they are potentially part of the 'definition' of the sequence.  Some are specific to this profile as they are specific to the observation of the sequence.
