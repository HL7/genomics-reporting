    <i>Described Variant</i> is a new term that HL7 has assigned to the notion of Simple, Discrete and Structural variants.  We have done this because of the difficulty of drawing a clear line between these other labels for variants.  The rules are often driven by the registries to which the variants are submitted and are not necessarily consistent.  The difference may be driven by testing methodology rather than a difference in the underlying genetic characteristic.

    This profile allows a full description of the variant found using properties from a variety of testing approaches and allowing for a variety of descriptive mechanisms.  Labs are encouraged to populate what properties they know.  In future versions of this implementation guide, HL7 may provide additional guidance on what properties should be sent in which situations and may subdivide <i>Described Variant</i> into multiple sub-profiles with more specific purpose.
